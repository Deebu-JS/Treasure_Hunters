________________________________________Project Brief: Student Performance Analyzer
Executive Summary
Educational institutions need efficient ways to track academic performance across multiple subjects. Manually calculating these metrics is time-consuming and error-prone. This project solves that by delivering a secure, React-based Single-Page Application (SPA) that automates the calculation of totals, averages, and grades while dynamically highlighting top-performing students in a premium, responsive interface.
Core Architecture & Features
The application uses a highly cohesive, component-based structure to ensure maintainability:
●	Modular Components: * App.jsx: Central state management and routing.
○	Login.jsx: Authentication gatekeeper.
○	MarksEntry.jsx: Dynamic data-entry form.
○	Results.jsx: Analytical dashboard.
●	Dynamic Curriculum Management: Subjects are handled as a dynamic array. Adding or removing subjects (e.g., adding "History") automatically updates all input forms and result tables without altering core logic.
●	Automated Analytics: The system calculates totals and averages instantly upon submission. It features strict pass/fail logic, automatically flagging students who score below the passing threshold in any individual subject.
●	Premium UI/UX: Built with a custom Dark Theme to reduce eye strain. Features include responsive CSS Grids for dynamic layouts, multi-layered box shadows, and glowing hover states on interactive elements.
Technical Stack
●	Frontend: React.js (Functional Components, useState Hook)
●	Routing: React Router DOM (BrowserRouter, Protected Routes via <Navigate>)
●	Styling: Native CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Grid, Custom Gradients)
Business Value
1.	Data Integrity: Eliminates human calculation errors through automated, strictly-typed data processing.
2.	Scalability: The dynamic subject mapping allows the app to scale to any curriculum size without UI breakage.
3.	Security: Protected routes ensure sensitive student data is shielded behind an authentication layer.
4.	Immediate Insights: Color-coded metrics and the "Top Performer" highlight allow teaching staff to gauge class health at a single glance.
Future Roadmap
●	Backend Integration: Connect to Node.js/Express and a database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) for persistent data storage.
●	Data Visualization: Integrate Recharts/Chart.js for graphical class average insights.
●	Reporting: Implement PDF/CSV export functionality for administrative records.
